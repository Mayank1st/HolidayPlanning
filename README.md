# HolidayPlanning
Holiday Planning is a platform built with MongoDB Atlas, Chakra UI, Bootstrap, React, and Node. It integrates Google Calendar, allowing users to invite friends to events. When invitees accept via Gmail, the organizer receives a notification on their dashboard, ensuring seamless holiday planning.
